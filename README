* Installation Instructions

This project requires that the switchprint daemon be installed and
running on your system.  Running the daemon under your user is
probably preferable in the short term.
More details here: https://github.com/Aeva/switchprint

Next, be sure that python-dbus is installed.  You also need
python-setuptools to finish the installation process.

On Debian, you can do it like so:
$ sudo apt-get install python-dbus python-setuptools

On Fedora, it looks like this:
$ sudo yum install pyserial python-daemon python-setuptools

python-gobject is also a dependency, but will be installed
automagically via distutils when you install this package.

Once you have the dependencies installed, install printcontrol like so
$ git clone https://github.com/Aeva/printcontrol.git
$ cd printcontrol
$ sudo python setup.py develop

Rather than doing "sudo python setup.py install", use the develop
version.  This will pull down any needed dependencies and setup
symlinks in various path locations to point to the relevant parts of
the repository.  Do not delete the cloned folder after running the
setup command.  Also, the "install" variant is broken currently.
