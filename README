* Installation Instructions

This project requires that the switchprint daemon be installed and
running on your system.  Running the daemon under your user is
probably preferable in the short term.
More details here: https://github.com/Aeva/switchprint

Next, be sure that python-dbus is installed.

On debian, you can do it like so:
$ sudo apt-get install python-dbus

python-gobject is also a dependency, but will be installed
automagically via distutils when you install this package.

Once you have the dependencies installed, install printcontrol like so
$ git clone git://github.com/Aeva/printcontrol.git
$ cd printcontrol
$ sudo python setup.py install

-->  If you're planning on hacking on switchprint, do this instead:
$ sudo python setup.py develop
